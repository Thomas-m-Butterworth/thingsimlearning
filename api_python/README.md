# Python API Project

## The Aim
My aim is to create an app that searches a title on IMDB, pulls the imdbID, requests that data on a seperate endpoint to pull the film's star rating. This star rating is then returned to tell the user if the film is in the "butterzone" (3.5 - 5).

I will also have to learn *Flask* or *Django* (probably both) to run the app.
