# Object Orientated Programming
My attempts to get my head around Object Orientated Programming (OOP) in Python. I am using a variety of online resources including FreeCodeCamp and Real Python.

## Objects
There are inbuilt classes in python that are used before even realising they're objects. These are functions, integers, strings, and booleans. It is possible to create our own classes, which is the nature of OOP.

## Methods
A method is performed upon an object, and rely on the type of class. (e.g. x.**strip()**, anything following the . is the method, arguments go into parenthesis)

## Creating our own classes
Define the class (in my example this is the Dog class). Define the operations that this kind of object can perform. Multiple methods can be defined within one class. By default they take the *self* argument, but others can be added (**see *add_one* in Dog.**)

Because a class has infinite reusability, I will be remembering this by humming **"OOPs I did it again"** to myself.
